# NetBSD-BWI-Firmware
This is the BCM Wireless Card Firmware originally written for DragonflyBSD and ported over to NetBSD, forget who wrote this. Forking this to my GitHub for any other NetBSD users who may want this firmware without the hassle of trying to create a USB to move it over from another computer.
